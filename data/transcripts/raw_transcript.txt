Martina and I just got back from India
0:03
yeah so let me tell you I started
0:07
posting on Facebook and Twitter that we
0:09
were gonna go out there to do these
0:10
shows and then people started sending me
0:12
messages questioning what I was gonna do
0:14
first of all are they gonna understand
0:17
you in India will they understand
0:19
English okay will they be able to follow
0:21
along with your stories once we got
0:24
there I come to find out that more
0:26
people speak English in India than in
0:29
all of the u.s. and Canada put together
0:32
might as well throw Mexico in there for
0:34
extra credit because there's that many
0:38
people and yes they have the internet
0:40
they got the Internet they got Bollywood
0:42
they got Hollywood they understand
0:43
American culture so much more than we
0:46
understand theirs second thing people
0:49
tried to warn me about going over there
0:51
Gabriel be careful India is a
0:54
third-world country don't drink the
0:56
water in India
0:57
it contains parasites that'll make you
0:59
really sick don't eat the food from the
1:02
street people especially the street meat
1:04
it contains a parasite that'll make you
1:06
really sick and most importantly there's
1:09
a lot of crime over there don't stay out
1:11
late when the Sun Goes Down
1:16
I'm like is it that bad
1:21
so I'm like let me get this straight
1:22
there's a lot of crime don't stay out
1:24
late don't eat any of the food from the
1:26
street vendors and don't drink the water
1:29
why does that sound familiar that's
1:36
Mexico
1:46
when Martina and I got over there we
1:49
found out that Indian people and Mexican
1:52
people have so much in common you guys
1:54
I'm telling you it's insane how similar
1:57
we are especially the food the food is
2:00
so similar for example Mexicans love
2:03
tortillas Indian people love naan bread
2:06
which is a fluffier form of a tortilla
2:09
Mexicans love chicken Indians love
2:12
chicken Mexicans love hot and spicy
2:14
Indians invented hot and spicy most
2:17
popular drink in Mexico is Fanta most
2:20
popular drink in India is Fanta Indian
2:24
people worship cows Mexicans love
2:26
barbecues a lot of similarities most of
2:32
the people that I met over there were
2:34
very hard-working and humble and I got
2:37
to tell you every time I talk to someone
2:38
I was always greeted the same way they
2:40
look at me they put their hands together
2:42
they do a little bow and they say
2:44
namaste which is an endearing hello it's
2:49
really nice and sweet and then I noticed
2:51
that Indian people when you're talking
2:53
to them do this thing with their head or
2:55
it will begin to move side to side as
2:59
they're speaking now first when you
3:01
notice that you think oh he slept wrong
3:03
he just got a kink in his neck get a
3:06
tempur-pedic
3:06
[Music]
3:08
now when they they start speaking their
3:10
head starts moving and I noticed this
3:12
the guy is checking us into the hotel
3:13
and he's really cool he's like listen if
3:16
you have any problems at all okay you
3:17
call the front is to press zero we will
3:19
send somebody to your room to help you
3:21
by ever you need you we got it for you
3:23
right here okay very good
3:24
now one thing I notice is the more they
3:26
talked and the more excited Indian
3:29
people get the more the head starts to
3:31
move around somebody at the hotel yelled
3:34
out to the clerk that's fluffy and the
3:36
guy was like oh my god I don't believe
3:37
it I can do it I thought it was so crazy
3:41
I work on fluffy love you love it even
3:45
crazier than that is that the mouth is
3:47
actually connected to the neck when the
3:51
mouth stops moving the head stops
3:53
wherever the mouth left off and when you
3:55
see Indian people talking to each other
3:57
you can see it okay let me tell you son
3:59
okay put it okay hold up wait wait wait
4:01
wait wait wait okay
4:02
like if you're Indian and you stutter
4:04
you are so screwed
4:07
i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i
4:10
somebody stop it
4:16
I'm not gonna lie you guys when I first
4:19
saw this happen I thought it was
4:21
hysterical I thought it was funny but
4:25
then I started thinking about it head
4:27
movement is just a form of expression no
4:30
matter where you live in this world
4:32
people express themselves in their own
4:34
unique way whether through facial
4:37
expressions hand gestures body movement
4:40
extra words everywhere you go things are
4:44
different and that's just how they
4:45
express themselves in India now back to
4:48
the whole Indians Mexican thing that is
4:50
something else that we share in common
4:52
with Indian people head movement now
4:55
some of you in the building tonight are
4:56
like stupid
4:58
we don't have head movement yes we do
5:00
it's a little different see with Indian
5:03
people the head movement is side to side
5:06
Mexicans are head movement is front to
5:09
back the difference between that is that
5:14
with Mexicans we have to be very very
5:16
upset in order for you to see the head
5:19
movement otherwise you can't tell with
5:21
Indians it's all the time or today is
5:24
such a nice day it is such a beautiful
5:27
day today I am so happy it's very nice
5:29
very good for my god I can't believe it
5:31
so nice is that a Brit Mexicans when
5:33
we're mad that's when it comes out for
5:36
non-latinos it trust me you cut off a
5:38
Mexican in traffic see what happens
5:40
[Music]
5:53
that's funny I don't know why the black
5:56
people are laughing you guys take it all
5:57
I don't know you did it oh hell no I
6:00
know you're talking about me I made
6:11
myself dizzy so let me tell you guys if
6:18
you ever get the opportunity to travel
6:23
to India I encourage you to check it out
6:27
you are gonna see some beautiful things
6:29
you are gonna see some amazing things
6:32
you're gonna see some sad depressing
6:35
things and some real horrible things
6:37
overall it's a well-balanced trip but
6:42
when you get back home here to the
6:44
United States you will have a whole
6:46
different appreciation for your life
6:49
believe that I guarantee this you guys
6:54
there's a lot of people in India and
6:56
what a lot of people comes a lot of
6:58
traffic
6:59
first things first American traffic and
7:02
Indian traffic very different here
7:05
whatever happens on the freeway will
7:07
stop the whole freeway in India there's
7:10
10 times the traffic but it moves
7:14
see the problem is Americans were
7:16
fascinated by accidents we're fascinated
7:18
by the idea of seeing potential death
7:20
that's why we slow down on the freeways
7:23
we say we don't want to see it but what
7:25
happens in traffic there doesn't even
7:33
have to be a collision you could be on
7:35
the 101 freeway and a car has a tire
7:37
blowout and it's spins doesn't hit
7:41
anything it's now facing oncoming
7:43
traffic you know what happens to the
7:45
rest of the freeway even on the other
7:50
freeway where there's no accident
7:58
somebody might be dead sorry
8:01
[Applause]
8:03
in India if there's an accident in the
8:06
middle of the street you know what they
8:08
do they drive right around it they don't
8:11
stop and it's not that they're not
8:12
sensitive to the situation they are it's
8:15
just that there's so much chaos that
8:17
happens on a regular basis they just
8:19
need to get to work they do see what's
8:21
happening and believe me their heartfelt
8:23
you know they'll drive around I'm so
8:25
sorry for you nothing stops the flow of
8:31
traffic in India they need to get from
8:33
point A to point B and so they go they
8:37
go if there's an accident they drive
8:38
around if there's something blocking the
8:39
street they get on the sidewalk to go
8:41
around it's amazing the way they drive
8:44
and here's something else no one uses
8:46
turn signals over there no one uses turn
8:49
signals they use a horn now if you go to
8:53
India tomorrow from the time you get
8:54
there to the time you leave you're
8:56
constantly gonna hear a horn it's an
8:58
actual language when people are driving
9:00
I'll show you
9:01
you're driving a car on your right
9:04
current car on your left
9:06
quicker light up ahead they talk to each
9:08
other while they're driving and they
9:09
barely miss each other every single time
9:13
also you'll be on the 101 freeway here
9:15
and there'll be six lanes in India
9:18
you'll see six lanes but guess what
9:19
you'll see twelve cars across
9:22
yes they have lines but they're
9:24
basically there to let you know more or
9:25
less the direction you might want to go
9:27
in they're this close to each other and
9:30
even at the light that communicating you
9:34
see everything cars trucks vans
9:36
motorcycles pedestrians cows children
9:39
all waiting for the light and they talk
9:44
at the light with the horn current very
9:46
good you can go you can go turn welcome
9:49
you're welcome go go nothing stops the
9:53
flow of traffic over there Indian people
9:55
drive think of ants you know how ants
9:59
travel in a straight line and if there's
10:01
something in the way like a rock ants
10:03
will split up go around the Rock and
10:06
reunite or climb over the rock worst
10:08
case scenario they dig a whole angle
10:10
under the rock that's the mentality of
10:13
driving in India a man can get shot in
10:16
the middle of the street people just
10:20
look at each other somebody pick him up
10:23
and they'll drag his ass onto the
10:26
sidewalk and if there's an accident and
10:28
they need to get around guess what's
10:29
gonna happen to that guy on the sidewalk
10:34
nothing stops the flow of traffic in
10:37
India except a cow now I know we've
10:42
always heard the stories and the jokes
10:44
about all Indian people don't eat
10:45
hamburgers I asked the question and I
10:47
found out it's believed that cows are
10:51
people who have died and they've been
10:53
reincarnated and their new life is now
10:55
the cow which is why they don't eat them
10:58
and why they give them all the love and
10:59
respect in the world over there I saw
11:02
this firsthand there's a cow crossing
11:04
the street while we're driving and the
11:06
cows know they're cocky they know that
11:08
they can cross
11:19
[Music]
11:23
no one honks at the cows no one yells at
11:27
the cows no one touches the cows they
11:29
wait for the cows to finish crossing the
11:31
cow that we had laid down the driver
11:36
just shut off the car started tweeting
11:39
there is a cow in the middle of the
11:44
street hashtag Moo Moo
11:52
I asked the driver what's going on
11:57
Saturday there is a count I see that
12:01
there's a cow are you gonna honk at it
12:03
go around what's what's gonna happen we
12:05
cannot we cannot honk at a cow we must
12:08
wait for the cow to move you're caring I
12:11
am not kidding we must wait for the cow
12:15
we drove past a dead body 15 minutes ago
12:21
that is probably him
12:33
like seriously the driving situation
12:36
over there is so intense you guys one
12:39
morning one morning while we're there I
12:40
needed to get to the airport fast
12:42
because I overslept and so I get in the
12:44
cab and I hand the driver a fifty dollar
12:47
bill and I go sir I am running very late
12:49
I need to get to the airport as soon as
12:52
possible whatever side street you have
12:54
to take or back road I'm all for it
12:56
whatever you have to do let's do it and
12:58
I handle the money and it goes very good
13:00
let's go and we take off the guy is
13:04
hitting anywhere from fifty to seventy
13:06
miles an hour on the street we are
13:09
making incredible time I notice that
13:15
we're heading in the direction of a red
13:17
light you ever been in a car with
13:20
someone and you're paying attention to
13:23
what's going on and you notice that
13:25
you're about to hit a red light and you
13:27
you know how you start to mentally and
13:29
physically prepare yourself for the
13:32
deceleration of the car and you start
13:34
anticipating the pressure from the brake
13:37
and if you don't get the sensation of
13:39
slowing down by a certain point all
13:41
alarms go off in your head and you sock
13:43
the driver in the chest not only did I
13:49
not get the sensation of slowing down I
13:51
got the opposite he gunned it towards
13:54
the light and it caught me off guard I
13:57
couldn't even scream I was like and then
14:03
I got air he didn't even know what he
